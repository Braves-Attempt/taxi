# Taxi Transport Library

[![Build Status](https://github.com/fpganinja/taxi/workflows/Regression%20Tests/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/fpganinja/taxi/actions/)

AXI, AXI stream, Ethernet, and PCIe components in System Verilog.

GitHub repository: https://github.com/fpganinja/taxi

## Introduction

The goal of the Taxi transport library is to provide a set of performant, easy-to-use building blocks in modern System Verilog facilitating data transport and interfacing, both internally via AXI and AXI stream, and externally via Ethernet, PCI express, UART, and I2C.  The building blocks are accompanied by testbenches and simulation models utilizing Cocotb and Verilator.

This library is currently under development; more components will be added over time as they are developed.

## License

Taxi is provided by FPGA Ninja, LLC under either the CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal (CERN-OHL-S 2.0), or a paid commercial license.  Contact info@fpga.ninja for commercial use.  Note that some components may be provided under less restrictive licenses (e.g. example designs).

Under the strongly-reciprocal CERN OHL, you must provide the source code of the entire digital design upon request, including all modifications, extensions, and customizations, such that the design can be rebuilt.  If this is not an acceptable restriction for your product, please contact info@fpga.ninja to inquire about a commercial license without this requirement.  License fees support the continued development and maintenance of this project and related projects.

To facilitate the dual-license model, contributions to the project can only be accepted under a contributor license agreement.
